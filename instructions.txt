First, the assumption is that a Python 3.8 interpreter and PostgreSQL is installed.
If not, Homebrew can be used to install Python 3.8 and PostgreSQL with the commands

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

to install Homebrew, then the commands

brew install python

to install Python 3.8, and

brew install postgresql

to install PostgreSQL.

Navigate to this "SampleProject" directory in a command line (in my case, in Terminal on macOS.)
After that, run the command

pip install pipenv

This will install pipenv.
Create a virtual environment with the required packages for this project by then running

pipenv install

This should install all of the dependencies needed to run the script data_challenge.py into a virtual environment.
Now, run the command

pipenv run python data_challenge.py

from inside the "SampleProject" project directory, and the project should run as intended.
After running this script, which will build and populate the Postgres tables, the commands

pipenv run python validation_script.py

can be run to confirm that the shape of the data in each file conforms to the generated columns and row counts in the Postgres tables.
